# Twitch-Tours
Site for finding your favorite streamer's best moments in recent videos on Twitch.tv

Uses NodeJS for back-end and ExpressJS for front-end to enable fans of popular Twitch.tv streamers to find moments in their VODs where the chat repeated a certain phrase (chosen by client) concurrently in a short span of time (typically an indicator of a good moment to capture). Uses 3 different APIs and gives back links to the exact moment in the video where the events occurred. Also included a python script not implemented in the app's final design that can be used to download exact portions of a video (based in ms) from any site with video content.
